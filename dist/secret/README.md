# Do You Wanna Go Out With Me?

This is an interactive webpage where users are asked if they want to go out. Please use this code as inspiration and avoid simply copying it without understanding or giving credit.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: Two buttons, "Yes" and "No", offer the user a simple interaction. When the user clicks "Yes," it triggers a function that could lead to a new page or action. The "No" button moves when hovered over.


## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the page, including the layout and visual aspects of the buttons and GIF.
- `script.js`: A JavaScript file where you can add interactivity like the `nextPage()` function and button animations.
- `yes.css`: Contains the styling for `yes.html`, which you will need to design as desired.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the initial page, including the layout and visual aspects of the buttons and GIF.
