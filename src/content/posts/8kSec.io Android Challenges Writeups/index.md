## My n00b Journey Through Android Security Challenges

Welcome to my writeup series for the [8kSec.io Android Application Exploitation Challenges](https://academy.8ksec.io/course/android-application-exploitation-challenges). As a n00bie in Android security, I'm documenting my journey through 11 vulnerable Android applications that cover everything from password managers to privacy tools. Each challenge teaches different exploitation techniques including reverse engineering, dynamic analysis, and vulnerability discovery.
Will it be easy? :"D
