## My n00b Journey Through iOS Security Challenges

Welcome to my writeup series for the [MHL iOS Application Exploitation Challenges](https://www.mobilehackinglab.com/course/lab-captain-nohook). As a n00bie in iOS Security, I'm documenting my journey through 11 vulnerable iOS applications that cover everything from password managers to privacy tools. Each challenge teaches different exploitation techniques including reverse engineering, dynamic analysis, and vulnerability discovery.
Will it be easy? :"D
