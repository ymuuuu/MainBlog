## Exam Review
The ISC2 CC exam is comprehensive, rich in content, and consists of multiple-choice questions. It is not as straightforward as some might claim; most questions require not just memorization but a deep understanding to identify the best choice among several options. The exam is designed to be tricky, so it is crucial to read each question carefully. I completed the exam in approximately 25 minutes.

The exam took place at the AUC - Engineering Faculty Building. Candidates are not allowed to bring any personal belongings into the testing hall; these must be left in a locker provided outside. Inside the testing hall, other candidates may also be taking exams. An escort will guide you to your designated PC where you will begin your exam. The testing hall is closely monitored, so any attempts to circumvent the rules will be detected. If you need assistance during the exam, simply raise your hand, and a proctor will attend to you.

Overall, the ISC2 CC exam is a rigorous assessment of your cybersecurity knowledge and skills. Success requires not only preparation but also careful attention to detail during the exam.
